		<h1> Beer for the people who like beer </h1>
		<h2> I decided to make a website about my love of beer that had suggestions for others,
		of beers they could try based on the beers they've had before. <br> </br>I previously did a similar thing with movie suggestions
		and it seemed to work out for all who took my advice. Now, these are all subjective so just some thoughts on what you may
		want to give a shot if you're looking for something new to drink. Also obviously availablity is always a big factor in the
		top end beers I will talk about but my other suggetions are typically easier to get things. </h2>

		<h3> My story and journey of how I got to where I am in the beer sense. Read if you want some background, otherwise feel free
		to click on the styles that interest you from the menu above. </h3>
		<p>  My name is Shawn and I have been an avid craft beer drinker for about 10 years now. I like many of you started drinking beer
		on the very low side of the scale. Originally when I started drinking I refused to drink beer because of the bitter taste and
		would instead drink only hard alcohol with sweet things like tea, gatorade, and mixers. Then the popularity of
		<span>beer pong</span> took off. Man did that start things on a crazy ride into the wild world of beer that I know today.
		Obviously with <span>Beer Pong</span> you don't want to go around wasting good beer, so we started with Coors Light and the
		"turtle beer" (Caguma). You had to chug these beers to avoid the poor taste. To try and get around this we experimented with
		the other major beers; bud, bud light, mgd, miller lite, pabst, keystone, busch, busch light, busch ice, and pretty much anything
		that was on sale in 18 or 30 pack cans. Well none of those were great, though we did settle on miller lite and it's tripple hops
		brewed taste for a while. </p>
		<p> For our sipping beers the first ones we really liked were Blue Moon and Sam Adams. I think like most early drinkers they
		provided the bridge from mainstream to the craft scene. Sam Adams Cherry Wheat I recall as being one of my favorite beers to
		drink leasurily during a night of drinking. Also like most craft beer afficionados the first time I tried an IPA I wanted to
		wash my mouth out with soap for days. It was just too in my face for the time and having a strong malt back bone with so much
		and different/new hop flavors made me think of potpurri. It wasn't until I had a Stone IPA that I really understood what the
		style was really about. Stone and Lagunitas IPA were the first 2 that really made me think about giving the style a chance. Once I
		had, man was my world opened. Like IPAs I was slow to enjoy most styles of beers and with the exception of lagers, I pretty much like
		all styles. Do I normally go for higher abv, larger ibu, yeah, but I can enjoy a session here and there.</p>
		<p> With the new found love of beers I set out on a journey to try as many different and new beers as I could get my hands on. Making
		my first pilgramige to the beer mecca of the west, San Diego roughly 10 years ago. They were/are still on the cutting edge of the
		beer scene. Thanks to the foundation I set by visiting Stone Brewing, Port/Lost Abbey, Alesmith, and Ballast Point, all of which I
		still love to this day, I gained something that has become a large part of my life. I dream of owning/running a brewery and being able
		to come up with beers that my friends and family could be proud of. I seek out new, different, and great beers whenever I hear, see,
		read about them. These beers are the recomendations I give to you to consider for yourself. Having enjoyed thousands of beers with
		my friends I have come to know that everyones taste buds are not the same even when we may agree a lot. I am fond of the 5 star scale
		in quarter star incriments, and this will be how I will rate my recomendations. So without further ado, on to the real content; choose between
